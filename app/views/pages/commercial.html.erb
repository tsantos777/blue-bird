    <p class="text-lg">
      The first major milestone on the journey to becoming an airline pilot is obtaining your commercial pilot certificate. Building upon the foundation of your private pilot certificate, the commercial pilot certificate opens up new opportunities and privileges in the aviation industry. As a commercially certified pilot, you gain the ability to fly for compensation or hire, paving the way for a professional career in aviation. Our comprehensive flight training program for the commercial pilot certificate focuses on advanced aircraft maneuvers, precision navigation, emergency procedures, and in depth cross country flight planning. While some individuals pursue this certification for personal or recreational reasons, it serves as a crucial step for those aspiring to embark on a fulfilling career as an airline pilot or in other professional pilot job roles.

    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">What's the Difference Between Commercial Pilots and Airline Pilots</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">
    
    Airline pilots fly regularly scheduled flights and must have an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate which is the highest pilot license the FAA issues.  However, before earning your ATP, you must get your private, instrument, and commercial certificates first.</p>

    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">How Long Will it Take?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">The amount of time required to earn a commercial pilot certificate varies and largely depends on weather, availability, finances, and how often a student is available to fly. In our accelerated program, a commercial certificate can be earned in approximately six months. If flying only a few times a week, expect to be ready for your checkride after a year.</p>

    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">What are the Eligibility Requirements?</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc text-lg pl-10 lg:pl-16">
      <li>Hold a valid private pilot certificate</li>
      <li>250 hours total flight time</li>
      <li>100 hours pilot in command (PIC)</li>
      <li>50 hours cross country</li>
      <li>10 hours instrument</li>
      <li>10 hours in a technically advanced aircraft</li>
      <li>Receive flight training and a logbook endorsement from an authorized instructor</li>
      <li>Pass a practical test for the aircraft rating sought</li>
    </ul>
